This Hackathon version for the [BOOT.DEV Hackathon 2025](https://blog.boot.dev/news/hackathon-2025/) currently relies on a GEMINI API key. Follow the installation steps to set everything up correctly.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and move into the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LS-2ednar/BiteWise
```
```bash
cd BiteWise
```

2. Create a new Python virtual environment for this project:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

or

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Optain a Gemini API key (a free plan is available).
- First, create an account here: [https://aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com). 
- Once your account is set up, generate your API key here: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) by clicking the "Create API Key" button. 
- If you encounter any issues, consult the [official docmentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key?hl=en) if you struggle.

6. Create an ```.env``` file: 
```bash

```

Add the following line to your ```.env``` file: 

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
